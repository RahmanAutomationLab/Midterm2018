Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?
A. A programing language is a high-level language for the computer to be execute. It is a set of instructions that programmers used to develop
software program,building games and solving algorithm.
What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
A. JDK stands for java development kit. JDK components  are: JRE ,Javac compiler,JVM, Debugger, Java doc etc.
jre is the Run Time Environment which consist of JVM and other files.
JVM is the virtual machine where byte codes are executed.
What is IDE?
A. IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment where coder write code,compile and debug code like eclipse.
What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
A. There are many IDEs available in the market. Java support Eclipse,NetBeans,IntelliJ IDEA ,JDeveloper,BlueJ and so on.
Explain the entire java life cycle.
A. Java life cycle stats while writing a source code (.java file)in a note pad or any IDE (eclipse).We call the java compiler
to produce byte codes and its creates the bytes codes which is .class file. Bytes codes is interpreted by Jvm
and sends to the OS and provides the output.
what is class?
A. A class is a blue print or template of an object.
What is object?
A. Each and every elements which is belongs to class is called objects.
What is the entry point of an application?
A. The main method is the entry point of an application.
Why main is static?
A. We declare Main method as a static because Main method need to load to jvm without creating object
of that class.
Which class is the superclass of all classes?
A. Object class is the super base class of all Java classes

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
A..Path and Classpath both are environment variable path is used by the operating system to find
the executables whereas classpath variable which is used by the Java compiler
to find the path, of classes.
What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
A. In interface, we can only declare methods which are abstract by default  but in abstract class, method can be abstract and non-abstract.
Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
A.No, we can use Interface by implements and extends by Abstract class.
what is Access Specifier?
A. Access Specifier determines how accessible the field,methods is to code in other classes. This could  be public, private, protected,final etc.

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
A. OOPs>> Object Oriented Programming is concept of Interface, Inheritance,Encapsulation,Abstraction and Polymorphism.
Interface is a road map for a concrete class. It is contract between classes.
Inheritance is required/inherit object and properties from parents to child class.
Encapsulation is data hiding.
Abstraction is hiding internal details and showing the functionality.
Polymorphism has many forms.A single task can perform in many ways.

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
A. A java package is a namespace that we can organizes a set of related classes and interfaces. java.lang package is imported by default,

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
A.API stands for application programming interface.

Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
A.NO. Instead it  support multiple interface because of to avoid avoid the ambiguity of classes.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
A. When a class have two or more Method with the same name but different parameter is called method overloading.
It's happens when we perform one operation with different arguments.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
A. It is a technique to handle the runtime error of a java application. We can handle by try-catch block,finally, throw etc.

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
A. Static keywords is used for memory management in java. Static variable and method are not related to object; it is related to class.
A static method invoked without creating an instance of a class.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
A. Final is used to apply  restrictions on class,method and variable. Final variable is constant
,can't be changed. Final method can't me overridden.
What is final, finally and finalize?
A. Final class can't be inherited and final variable can't be changed.Final method can't me overridden.
Finally is placed to important code to be executed whether exception is handled or not.
Finalize is used to perform clean up processing. It is the called the garbage collection.

What is a constructor ?
A.Constructor is a special types of method that is used to initialize the object.
It is called when an instance of object is created and memory is allocated for the object

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
A.Yes.
If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
A.A default constructor will be called.

What is "this" keyword in java ?
A. "this" keyword is a reference variable that refers to the current object."this" keyword can be used to invoke current class method , constructor so on.
What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
A. "Super" keywords is reference variable in java.It is used  to refer immediate parent class object,method or constructor.
What is JVM stand for ?
A. Java Virtual Machine.
Is JVM platform independent?
A.yes.

What version of java are you using?
A.Java 8.
What is JAR stand for ?
A JRE>>Java Run Time Environment.
What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
A. JDK consist of JRE and Development tools like JVM ,libraries and files. Jvm is a virtual machine where bytes codes are executed.
What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
A.JRE is implementation of JVM.It contains the libraries and files which is used by JVM.
What is compile time and run time?
A.When an application is running is called the runtime. Before runtime source code need to be complied by the javac to produce byte code.
The process of compilation is called the compile time.

What is heap?
A.Heap is the runtime data area or memory location for all class instances and arrays is allocated
How java manage it's memory?
A. When java memory become full the garbage collector clean up the heap. Means destroy the the unused object and make space for the new obj.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
A.String is immutable object.Once it assigned can not be changed.
StringBuffer is mutable means one can change the value of the object.StringBuffer is stored in the heap.
StringBuilder is similar to StringBuffer,but not thread safe.

What is Singleton class?
A. In Singleton class is a class where we can create instance only once.

when to use transient variable in java?
A.
Difference between while and do..while loop?
A. In do ..while loop code must execute at least once without checking the condition. Otherhand, While loop  check the condition first then execute the code.
What is Enum?
A.Enum is a special kind of Java class. An enum can contain constants, methods etc.
What is Iterator?
A.Iterator is an interface which provide iterator() to iterate on collection. We use to get value stored in collection.
Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
A.No difference b/w them.
Why is String Immutable in Java?
A.String Immutable means once create the object or assige value to the string can't be change.
What is constructor chaining in Java?
A.Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor with respect to current object.

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?

What is JIT stands for?
A.JIT stands for Just In time compilation.
Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
A.Java Heap Space is a memory location where created object can take place whereas garbage collection free the heap space by destroying the un used object.
Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
A. It is an automatic process.It will only trigger if JVM thinks it needs a garbage collection based on Java heap size.
It can choose to reject the request and so it is not guaranteed that these calls will do the garbage collection.

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
A. In stake, variables are declared and methods execution take place whereas heap stores all the instance.

What is reflection in java and why is it useful?

what is multithreading in java?
A.It is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.
Thread is basically a lightweight sub-process, a smallest unit of processing. Multiprocessing and multithreading, both are used to achieve multitasking.

What is the use of synchronization in Java?
A.Java Synchronization is a option where we want to allow only one thread to access the shared resource.
What is Framework?
A. Framework is a set of guidelines, instruction that we can use to  built our project and accomplished tasks.
What are the testing Framework available in java?
A. JUnit,Mockito,Jwalk,TestNG and so on.
Difference between jUnit and testNG?


What are the dependencies for this project?
A.MyQSL, MongoDB and TestNG.
what is dependency injection in java?
A. Dependency injection is a concept of a programming language. By this concept a class should not
configure its dependencies statically but should be configured from the outside.
What is static binding and dynamic binding?
A. When a binding is happened in compile time called static binding.Static, private and final methods is done at compile-time are static binding.
Dynamic Binding happened on run time and compiler doesn't decide the method to be called.
