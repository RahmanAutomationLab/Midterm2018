Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A. Data structure is a particular way of storing and organizing information in a computer so that it can be retrieved and used most productively.
Data structures are used  every program or software system. To retrieve data for specific function and algorithm.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
A. Traversing, Searching, Inserting, Deleting, Sorting and Merging.

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
A. Database Management System, Operating System, Compiler Design,
  Numerical Analysis, Graphics, Artificial Intelligence and Simulation etc.

what is an Array?
A.Array is a type of variable that holds a series of values at any given time. It is a fixed-size data structure.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
A.Array size is static in array, it's length is fixed. on the other-hand,Arraylist is dynamic, means size is not fixed.
what is LinkedList?
A. It is a linear structure where each element is a separate object.

How is an Array different from Linked List?
A.In Array, each element is independent from the previous or the next element by index.
On the other-hand,Linked list address of each element is stored in the link part of the previous element or node.

what is queue?
A.-A queue is designed to have elements inserted at the end of the queue, and elements removed from the beginning of the queue.
Queue follows First In First Out (FIFO) principle.

what is stack?
A.-sStack is a data structure that allows data to be inserted and removed. Stack follows Last In First Out (LIFO) -queue.
 Therefore last data to be inserted will be the first data to be removed.
what is FIFO and LIFO?
A. FIFO>>First In First Out
   LIFO>>Last In First Out

what is the order of complexity?
A. It is a certain mathematical expression of the size of the input, and the algorithm finishes between
two factors of it.
what is the best case to search an element from an array?
A.Binary search.

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
A.Hypothetical data set.

what is tree in data structure?
A.Tree represents the nodes connected by edges.

what is graph in data structure?
A.A graph is visual representation of a set of objects where some pairs of objects are connected by links.
The interconnected objects are represented by points termed as vertices, and the links that connect the vertices are called edges.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
A.HashTable is synchronized  whereas hashMap is not synchronised.
  HashTable does not allows null keys or values whereas HashMap allows null keys.

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
A.RDBMS uses Array
  Network data model uses Graphs and Hierarchical data model uses Trees.

How HashMap works in java?
A.HashMap stores both key and value object, in bucket, as an object of Entry class which implements the nested interface Map.Entry.
  HashMap provides put(key, value) for storing and get(key) method for retrieving Values from HashMap
  equals() method is used to compare objects for equality.

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
A.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is a runtime Exception thrown only at runtime.
  It occurs when Java program tries to access an invalid index, means an index which is not positive or
  greater than the length of an array.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
A.Object.clone()
  Arrays.copyOf()
  Arrays.copyOfRange()
  System.arraycopy()

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
A.In Array, each element is independent from the previous or the next element by index.
  On the other-hand,Linked list address of each element is stored in the link part of the previous element or node.

What is DFS and BFS?
A.DFS>>Depth First Search. It is a method for exploring a tree or graph. In a DFS, we go as deep as possible down one path before backing up
  and trying a different one. Here DFS explore one path, hit a dead end, and go back and try a different one.
  BFS>>Breadth First Search: It is a method for exploring a tree or graph. In a BFS, we first explore all the nodes one step away, then
  all the nodes two steps away and so on.

What is Recursion?
A.-Recursion in java is a process in which a method calls itself continuously.

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
A.-Linear data structures are Array, Stack, Queue and LinkedList.
  -Non Linear data structures are trees and graphs.

What is Big-(O)-notation?
A.Big-(O) notation is used to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Big-(O) specifically describes the
  worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used by an algorithm.

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
A.Insertion sort
  Selection sort
  Merge sort
  Heapsort
  Quicksort
  Bubble sort
  Shellsort

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
